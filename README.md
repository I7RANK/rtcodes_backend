# RTCODES

A simple REST API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to manage stores and their codes.
The project includes endpoints to list stores, create new ones, and update their active code while keeping a code history.

This project aims to solve a real need I’ve observed among rapitenderos (delivery workers) in my city. It is currently in a very early phase, and although I haven’t pushed new code recently, I’m actively working on data collection, mapping stores, and updating the database to better understand the requirements before continuing development.
